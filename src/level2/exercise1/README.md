# 🚀 Java Lambdas Exercise

## 🧩 What’s This About?
This repository contains the solution to a programming exercise designed to strengthen my skills in Java development. The project showcases the implementation of core concepts using Java, version control with Git, and project management with IntelliJ IDEA.

Create a list of strings with proper names. Write a method that returns a list of all strings that begin with the uppercase letter 'A' and are exactly 3 letters long. Print the result.

## 📚 Exercise Overview
This repository contains one programming exercise focused on Lamdas in Java.

📘 **Exercise Description**

In this task, you'll work with a list of proper names (e.g., names of people). The goal is to filter the list based on two conditions: names must start with an uppercase 'A' and be exactly three letters long.

🧠 **Task**

- Create a List<String> containing various proper names

- Implement a method that:

    - Filters and returns names that:
      - Start with the uppercase letter 'A' 
      - Are exactly 3 characters long

- Print the filtered names to the console

---

🧪 **Learning Objectives**

- Practice filtering collections using conditions

- Gain experience with String.startsWith() and .length()

- Strengthen functional programming skills with Stream.filter() or traditional loops
