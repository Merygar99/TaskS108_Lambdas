# 🚀 Java Lambdas Exercise

## 🧩 What’s This About?
This repository contains the solution to a programming exercise designed to strengthen my skills in Java development. The project showcases the implementation of core concepts using Java, version control with Git, and project management with IntelliJ IDEA.

This task involves transforming a list of integers into a specially formatted string. You'll apply conditional logic to tag each number as even or odd, and then join them with commas into a single output string.

## 📚 Exercise Overview
This repository contains one programming exercise focused on Lambdas in Java.

---

🧠 **Task**

- Write a method that:

    - Accepts a List<Integer> as input

    - Returns a String where:

        - Each even number is prefixed with "e"
        - Each odd number is prefixed with "o"

        - All elements are joined together into a single string, separated by commas

- Print the resulting formatted string to the console

---

🧪 **Learning Objectives**

- Practice basic conditionals (even vs. odd)

- Work with List<Integer> and string formatting

- Use StringBuilder, Stream API, or String.join() for joining elements

- Understand how to format custom string outputs programmatically

## 🙌 Made With a Little Help From

## ▶️ Execution

To run the program in IntelliJ IDEA:

Open the file containing the main method (Main.java). Right-click anywhere in the editor window. Select Run 'Main.main()' from the context menu. Alternatively, use the green triangle (▶️) icon next to the main method to run the program directly.
