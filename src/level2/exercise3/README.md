# 🚀 Java Lambdas Exercise

## 🧩 What’s This About?
This repository contains the solution to a programming exercise designed to strengthen my skills in Java development. The project showcases the implementation of core concepts using Java, version control with Git, and project management with IntelliJ IDEA.

## 📚 Exercise Overview
This repository contains one programming exercise focused on Lambdas in Java.

In this task, you'll work with Functional Interfaces and Lambda Expressions to implement dynamic arithmetic operations. You'll define a flexible interface that performs a numeric operation and then inject different behaviors (like addition or division) using lambdas.

---

🧠 **Task**

- Define a Functional Interface that includes:

    - A method called operacion()

    - It must return a float and take no parameters

- Create different lambda expressions that implement this interface to perform:

    - Addition

    - Subtraction

    - Multiplication

    - Division

- Use each lambda and print the result to the console


---

🧪 **Learning Objectives**

- Understand how to define and implement Functional Interfaces

- Apply lambdas to represent concise executable logic

- Practice switching behavior at runtime using functional injection

- Reinforce arithmetic operations using Java primitives and floats

## ▶️ Execution

To run the program in IntelliJ IDEA:

Open the file containing the main method (Main.java). Right-click anywhere in the editor window. Select Run 'Main.main()' from the context menu. Alternatively, use the green triangle (▶️) icon next to the main method to run the program directly.
