# 🚀 Java Lambdas Exercise

## 🧩 What’s This About?
This repository contains the solution to a programming exercise designed to strengthen my skills in Java development. The project showcases the implementation of core concepts using Java, version control with Git, and project management with IntelliJ IDEA.

## 📚 Exercise Overview
This repository contains one programming exercise focused on Lambdas in Java.

In this task, you'll manipulate a list containing both text strings and numeric values (as strings). You’ll perform several operations to sort, transform, and filter the list using lambda expressions and string handling methods.

🧠 **Task**

1. Create a List<String> that includes both words and numeric values (e.g. "hello", "42", "apple", "123").

2. Sort the list:

    - Alphabetically by the first character using charAt(0)

3. Sort again:

    - Put strings that contain the letter 'e' at the beginning

    - Implement this condition directly inside the lambda comparator

4. Modify each element that contains the letter 'a':

    - Replace each 'a' with a '4'

5. Filter and display only the elements that are purely numeric

🧪 **Learning Objectives**

- Use lambda expressions with Comparator and Collections.sort()

- Modify strings in a list using .replace() and map()

- Filter data using Stream.filter() and regular expressions

- Understand condition-based sorting and selective output in Java
