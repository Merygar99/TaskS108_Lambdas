# 🚀 Java Lambdas Exercise

## 🧩 What’s This About?
This repository contains the solution to a programming exercise designed to strengthen my skills in Java development. The project showcases the implementation of core concepts using Java, version control with Git, and project management with IntelliJ IDEA.

Using the list from the previous exercise, now sort it in reverse—from the longest string to the shortest.

## 📚 Exercise Overview
This repository contains one programming exercise focused on Lamdas in Java.

📘 **Exercise Description**

This task extends the previous one, where you sorted a list of mixed strings and numbers from shortest to longest. This time, you'll reverse the sorting order and arrange the strings from longest to shortest based on their character length.

🧠 **Task**

- Use the same List<String> from the previous exercise

- Sort the list by string length in descending order

- Print the result to the console

🧪 **Learning Objectives**

- Practice customizing sort orders with a comparator

- Gain fluency in reversing sort logic (e.g. using Comparator.reversed() or Collections.sort() with a custom comparator)

- Understand how lambda expressions or method references can simplify sorting tasks
