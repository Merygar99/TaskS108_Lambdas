# 🚀 Java Lambdas Exercise

## 🧩 What’s This About?
This repository contains the solution to a programming exercise designed to strengthen my skills in Java development. The project showcases the implementation of core concepts using Java, version control with Git, and project management with IntelliJ IDEA.

From a list of strings, write a method that returns a list of all strings containing the letter 'o'. Print the result.

## 📚 Exercise Overview
This repository contains one programming exercise focused on Lamdas in Java.

📘 **Exercise Description**

This exercise involves working with a list of strings and using Java logic to filter elements based on whether they contain a specific character.

🧠 **Task**

- Create a method that:

    - Accepts a list of String elements

    - Returns a new list containing only the strings that include the letter 'o' (case-sensitive)

- Print the filtered list to the console

🧪 **Learning Objectives**

- Practice iterating through collections (List<String>)

- Understand the use of string methods like .contains()

- Gain experience with basic filtering and printing in Java
