# 🚀 Java Lambdas Exercise

## 🧩 What’s This About?
This repository contains the solution to a programming exercise designed to strengthen my skills in Java development. The project showcases the implementation of core concepts using Java, version control with Git, and project management with IntelliJ IDEA.

Create a Functional Interface that contains a method named reverse(). This method must take a String as input and return a String.

## 📚 Exercise Overview
This repository contains one programming exercise focused on Lamdas in Java.

📘 **Exercise Description**

This exercise focuses on defining your own Functional Interface in Java and implementing it to reverse strings. Functional Interfaces are a foundational concept in Java’s functional programming model and are often used with lambda expressions.

---

🧠 **Task**

- Create a @FunctionalInterface that includes:

    - A method named reverse

    - The method must:

        - Accept a single parameter of type String

        - Return a String (the reversed input)

- Create a lambda expression or method reference to implement it

- Use this interface to reverse and print at least one string

---

🧪 **Learning Objectives**

- Understand the purpose and structure of Functional Interfaces

- Learn how to define single-method interfaces with @FunctionalInterface

- Apply lambdas to create clean, testable, and reusable behavior
