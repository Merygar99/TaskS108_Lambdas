# 🚀 Java Lambdas Exercise

## 🧩 What’s This About?
This repository contains the solution to a programming exercise designed to strengthen my skills in Java development. The project showcases the implementation of core concepts using Java, version control with Git, and project management with IntelliJ IDEA.

Create a list with numbers and strings, and sort the list with the strings ordered from shortest to longest.

## 📚 Exercise Overview
This repository contains one programming exercise focused on Lamdas in Java.

📘 **Exercise Description**

In this task, you'll create a list that includes both numbers and text strings. The goal is to sort the list by string length, arranging the elements from the shortest to the longest—only considering the string representation of each element.

- Create a list of elements containing both numbers and strings, stored as List<String>

- Sort the list based on the length of each string

- Print the sorted list to the console

🧪 **Learning Objectives**

- Practice sorting a list using a custom comparator

- Understand string representation of various data types

- Gain experience handling mixed content in a type-safe way
