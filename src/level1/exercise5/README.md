# 🚀 Java Lambdas Exercise

## 🧩 What’s This About?
This repository contains the solution to a programming exercise designed to strengthen my skills in Java development. The project showcases the implementation of core concepts using Java, version control with Git, and project management with IntelliJ IDEA.

Create a Functional Interface with a method called getPiValue() that must return a double.

## 📚 Exercise Overview
This repository contains one programming exercise focused on Lamdas in Java.

📘 **Exercise Description**

In this task, you'll define a Functional Interface in Java that represents a simple computation: returning the mathematical constant π (pi).

🧠 **Task**

- Create a Functional Interface named however you prefer (e.g. PiSupplier)

- The interface must declare a method named getPiValue()

    - Return type: double

    - No input parameters

- The interface must include the @FunctionalInterface annotation

- You can later use this interface with lambdas or method references

🧪 **Learning Objectives**

- Understand the purpose and structure of functional interfaces in Java

- Learn how to use the @FunctionalInterface annotation

- Explore lambda expressions as a tool to implement lightweight behavior
