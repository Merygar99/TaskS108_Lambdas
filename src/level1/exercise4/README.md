# 🚀 Java Lambdas Exercise

## 🧩 What’s This About?
This repository contains the solution to a programming exercise designed to strengthen my skills in Java development. The project showcases the implementation of core concepts using Java, version control with Git, and project management with IntelliJ IDEA.

Perform the same printing operation as the previous task, but using a method reference.

## 📚 Exercise Overview
This repository contains one programming exercise focused on Lamdas in Java.

📘 **Exercise Description**

This task is an extension of the previous one, which involved printing all month names using a lambda expression. Now, you'll do the same but using a method reference for a more concise and expressive syntax.

🧠 **Task**

- Use a List<String> containing all 12 month names

- Instead of using a lambda to print each item, use a method reference (System.out::println)

- Print the list to the console

🧪 **Learning Objectives**

- Practice using method references in place of simple lambdas

- Understand the syntax and readability benefits of :: notation

- Reinforce how method references work with functional interfaces
