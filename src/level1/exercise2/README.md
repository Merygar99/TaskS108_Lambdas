# 🚀 Java Lambdas Exercise

## 🧩 What’s This About?
This repository contains the solution to a programming exercise designed to strengthen my skills in Java development. The project showcases the implementation of core concepts using Java, version control with Git, and project management with IntelliJ IDEA.

You need to do the same as in the previous task, but now, the method must return a list of strings that not only contain the letter 'o', but also have more than 5 characters.

## 📚 Exercise Overview
This repository contains one programming exercise focused on Lamdas in Java.

📘 **Exercise Description**

This exercise builds upon the previous task of filtering strings containing a specific character. Now we refine the condition to apply an additional length constraint.

🧠 **Task**

- Create a method that:

    - Takes a List<String> as input

    - Returns a new list containing only the strings that:

    - Contain the letter 'o'

    - Have a length greater than 5 characters

- Print the result to the console

🧪 **Learning Objectives**

- Practice combining multiple conditions in filtering logic

- Reinforce usage of String.contains() and .length()

- Gain confidence with conditional list filtering using loops or streams in Java
