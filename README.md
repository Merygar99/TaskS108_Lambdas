🔁 **Java Lambda Expressions – Functional Programming with Style**

📘 **Overview**

This repository explores the use of Lambda Expressions in Java—an essential feature introduced in Java 8 that enables functional programming with concise, expressive syntax. Lambdas provide a streamlined way to pass behavior (functions) as arguments, especially useful when working with collections and functional interfaces.

🧩 **What You'll Learn**

  - ✅ The syntax and structure of lambda expressions

  - ✅ Functional interfaces and the @FunctionalInterface annotation

  - ✅ Using lambdas with List, Map, and Stream operations

  - ✅ Method references (::) and constructor references

  - ✅ Differences between lambdas and anonymous inner classes

  - ✅ Practical applications in event handling, filtering, and sorting

💡 **Benefits of Lambdas**

- More concise and readable code

- Encourages declarative programming style

- Enables functional patterns using the Java Streams API

- Greatly reduces boilerplate when working with event listeners and collections
